# Image-Based-Food-Recognition-and-Calorie-Estimation-in-Digital-Image-Processing
This project implements a system for recognizing Indian food items and estimating their caloric content using digital image processing and deep learning techniques. The system utilizes a pre-trained VGG16 CNN architecture for food classification, enhanced with data augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, and flipping to improve model generalization. The model is trained and evaluated on a curated dataset, achieving high accuracy in classifying images of Indian cuisine.

With potential applications in dietary management, restaurant automation, and the food industry, this project demonstrates the power of integrating image processing and machine learning for practical use cases.
